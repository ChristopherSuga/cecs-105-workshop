<h1>This grill is not a home</h1>
<p>A stove is a stove no matter where you go. A patty is a patty thats what I say. A grill is a grill this is surely so-o. And fries should be fries either way. But this grill is not a home. This is not the stove I know. I would trade it all away. If you come back and stay. This kitchen is not the same without you. Its just a grill. its just a greasy spoon. Without you..</p>
